# Fantasy-Premier-League-2024-2025-Stats

This is a report highlighting key statistics for Fantasy Premier League for the 2024-2025 season. 

You will see that there are two iterations of the report: one that highlights statistics through GW 16, as that was the most up-to-date data at the time, and the other that encompasses the whole season.

You will see a breakdown of numerous variables such as total points, PPG, bonus, total xGI, the ICT index, and pages focused on goalkeeper influence and the assistant manager chip.

I hope this report brings some insight into who are the best assets to own when playing Fantasy Premier League!
